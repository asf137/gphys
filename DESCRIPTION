Title: Analyse electrophysiology data acquired by Neuromatic / Igor Pro
Type: Package
Author: Greg Jefferis
Description: This package provides functions to make spike time raster
    plots for data acquired and pre-analysed by the Neuromatic package
    for Igor Pro. The input data format is a simple text file saved by
    Igor and could no doubt be generated by other spike sorting
    packages. See http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/ for details on
    Neuromatic.
