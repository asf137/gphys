gphys 0.5-4
===========
* Several small changes to PlotRasterFromSweeps
  - with pch='rect' (ie spikes as rectangles rather than dots) then 
    spikeheight option sets the relative spike height and defaults to much
    prettier looking value of 0.8 than its previous implicit value of 1.
  - new frame.plot option in PlotRasterFromSweeps to control whether a box
    surrounds he plot
  - xaxs and yaxs options to control whether the x and y axes are expanded.
    the default is now to use exactly the specified xlim and ylim (which is
    not R's default behaviour)
* teach subset.spiketimes to cope with ODD configs that have repeated odour
  names (but note that you still can't subset any of these repeated odours 
  by name, only by channel number)
* Option to convert NAs to 0 in OdourResponseFromSpikes (default TRUE)
* export is.spiketimes function

gphys 0.5-3
===========
* fix bug in visibility of "[.spiketimes" which was causing problems
  for Aaron's mergeSpiketrain function (because subsetting a spiketrains
  object produced a plain list rather than a new spiketimes object).
* Option to plot spikes with rectangles of specified width in 
  PlotRasterFromSweeps

gphys 0.5-2
===========
* some documentation improvements
  (PlotOdourResponseFromSpikes,[.spiketimes,finder_colour)

gphys 0.5-1
===========
* merge.spiketimes function for spiketimes objects with different odd configs
  (limited to case where there are the same number of trials for each odour).
* implemented proper subsetting of spiketimes object 
  ie spiketimesobj[1:3] now behaves properly
* +.spiketimes checks compatibility between spiketimes objects more carefully
* finder_colour_fast is much faster for long lists of files [ao]
* documentation fixes

gphys 0.5
=========
* Add functions for handling timeseries data (ie voltages rather than spikes)
  including: scale.ts, mean.mts, smooth_decimate, tsp.nclamppxp
  and a new plot function AddLinesToRasterPlot.
* IgorR package (on CRAN) is now a dependency (instead of a suggestion).

gphys 0.4-1
=========
* Option not to plot x and y axes in PlotRasterFromSweeps

gphys 0.4
=========
* CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps can now read/plot subsets of
  spkes defined by odour name or channel number.
* This depends on a new function subset.spiketimes.
* STAR package is now a dependency (which must be installed from CRAN).
* New as.repeatedTrain function will convert gphys spiketimes objects to STAR
  repeatedTrain objects, allowing STAR's psth function to be used.
* New fix.odd function to handle situation where ODD has been miswired
* Significant documentation improvements (including package docs ?gphys) 
gphys 0.3-2
=========
* You can now set options(gphys.datadir='/path/to/my/data') so that you can
  specify relative paths in CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps,
  ideally just the Igor cell name.

gphys 0.3-1
=========
* New OdourResponseFromSpikes function that can be used to extract the number or
  frequency of spikes in a window (optionally subtracting a baseline).
* PlotRasterFromSweeps plots left hand edge of box when the axis starts at time>0 

gphys 0.3
=========
* Teach CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps to use Jonny's spike subdirs
* Make sure that CollectSpikesFromSweeps/PlotRasterFromSweeps only reads ODD files
  that match the sweeps that have been selected.
* ?gphys shows package help
* utility functions to set and query Finder colour labels

gphys 0.2-1
=========
* plot odour stimulus as an opaque rectangle behind spike rasters rather than
  a semi-transparent one in front.

gphys 0.2
=========
* handle experiments with repeated identical blocks (using split.spiketimes)
* can now specify stimRange when collecting sweeps
* can now specify xlim when collecting sweeps
* and PlotRasterFromSweeps will use this info for plotting
* +.spiketimes allows multiple consistent spiketimes objects to be gathered together  

gphys 0.1
=========
* First version
