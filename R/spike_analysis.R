#' Calculate lifetime sparseness according to Olsen et al. 2008
#' 
#' minodours is interpreted as fraction when <=1. If >1 it is assumed then there
#' must be >= that many odour responses. Any cells that have been tested for 
#' fewer than than minodours will have a sparseness value of NA. Definition:
#' 
#' S = 1/(1-1/N)*( 1 - (sum(r/N)^2)/(sum(r^2/N)) )
#' 
#' where N is the number of odours and r is the analogue response intensity of 
#' the neuron to odour j minus baseline firing rate. Analogue response intensity
#' was the mean spike rate (averaged across five sweeps) during the entire 
#' 500-ms odour stimulus period. Any values of rj < 0 were set to zero before 
#' computing lifetime sparseness (this was the only analysis in this study in 
#' which negative responses were zeroed). Responses to paraffin oil (solvent 
#' control) were not considered in the sparseness analysis. We computed the 
#' lifetime sparseness for each individual cell in our study for which we tested
#' at least 12 of the odours in our set. We used the Mann--Whitney U test to 
#' assess the significance of sparseness differences.
