\title{Calculate lifetime sparseness according to Olsen et al. 2008}
\usage{
lifetime_sparseness(x, minodours = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of odour data with one column per odour, 1 row per cell}

\item{minodours}{Minimum number of odours required to compute valid score (see details)}
}
\value{
named numeric vector, one entry for each row (neuron) in x
}
\description{
minodours is interpreted as fraction when <=1. If >1 it is assumed then
there must be >= that many odour responses. Any cells that has been tested
for fewer than than minodours will have a sparseness value of NA
Definition:
S = 1/(1-1/N)*( 1 - (sum(r/N)^2)/(sum(r^2/N)) )
}
\details{
where N is the number of odours and r is the analogue response intensity of
the neuron to odour j minus baseline firing rate. Analogue response intensity
was the mean spike rate (averaged across five sweeps) during the entire 500-ms
odour stimulus period. Any values of rj < 0 were set to zero before computing
lifetime sparseness (this was the only analysis in this study in which
negative responses were zeroed). Responses to paraffin oil (solvent control)
were not considered in the sparseness analysis. We computed the lifetime
sparseness for each individual cell in our study for which we tested at least
12 of the odours in our set. We used the Mann–Whitney U-test to assess the
significance of sparseness differences.
